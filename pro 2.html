<h1>
    Big data
</h1>

<P><b><b>Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically
     extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are
      too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing <br>
      application software. Data with many fields (columns) offer greater 
      statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes 
      or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data 
      analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis,<br>
       search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information
        privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three
         key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data
          presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only 
          observations and sampling. Therefore, big data often includes data wit<br>
          h sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional
     software to process within an acceptable time and value.

<h2>
    Big data vs. business intelligence

</h2>
<p>  The growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between "big data" and "business intelligence":[24]

    Business intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things
    , detect trends, etc.
