    Big data has increased the demand of
     information management specialists so
      much so that Software AG, Oracle Corporation, IBM, 
      Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP, and Dell have spent more than 
      $15 billion on software firms specializing in data management and 
      analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100 billion
       and was growing at almost 10 percent a year: about twice as fast 
       as the software business as a whole.[5]
    Developed economies increasingly use data-intensive 
    technologies. There are 4.6 billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide, and between 1 billion and 2 billion people accessing the internet.[5] Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1 billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people became more literate, which in turn led to information growth. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65 exabytes in 2007[10] and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014.[5] According to one estimate, one-third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data,[53] which is the format most useful for most big data applications. This also shows the potential of yet unused data
     (i.e. in the form of video and audio content).
